World At War Mod Manager

Ever wanted a custom zombies map or mod but couldnt find the right download link.
Your in luck because this will solve that problem. Simply open the command prompt
and type in "./waw-manager.py -i" and the map name and boom the map is being installed.
What about that pesky UGX mod and all the copy and pasting now just type "./waw-manager.py -m"
and UGX Mod and the latest version is installed.

WARNING: This is NOT the FULL VERSION. Don't excpect most of this if not, any of this to work.
